## TRIBUNAL FINDINGS

### On Unfair Dismissal

The Tribunal considered:

1. **Was there a potentially fair reason?**
   - Yes - conduct (s.98(2)(b) ERA 1996)

2. **Was dismissal within range of reasonable responses?**
   - NO - The Tribunal found:
     - Single incident with no malicious intent
     - Immediate admission and apology
     - 4 years unblemished record
     - No evidence of actual reputational damage
     - Other employees had made similar errors without dismissal

3. **Procedural fairness**
   - Investigation was rushed (2 days)
   - No consideration of alternatives to dismissal
   - Appeal was not independent (heard by MD's brother)

### On Wrongful Dismissal

- The email error did NOT constitute gross misconduct
- Claimant entitled to notice pay

### On Holiday Pay

- 5.5 days accrued but unpaid
- Calculation: £736.00

2. Genuine mistakes ≠ automatic gross misconduct
3. Length of service and record are relevant
4. Must consider sanctions short of dismissal
5. Email system training is essential

## CASE SIGNIFICANCE

This case joins growing precedent that:
- Single email errors rarely justify dismissal
- "Bringing company into disrepute" requires actual evidence of harm
- Zero-tolerance policies must still be reasonably applied
