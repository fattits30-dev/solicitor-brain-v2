   - Contradictions in assessor's report

## MEDICAL EVIDENCE

### GP Letter (Dr. Sarah Mitchell, January 2024)
"Ms Johnson experiences severe fatigue on 5 out of 7 days. She requires assistance with meal preparation and personal care. Her mobility is significantly restricted, managing only 20-50 meters before severe discomfort."

### Rheumatologist Report (Mr. James Chen, February 2024)
"Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain affecting all daily activities. Patient experiences 'flare-ups' lasting 3-4 days where she is essentially bedbound."
