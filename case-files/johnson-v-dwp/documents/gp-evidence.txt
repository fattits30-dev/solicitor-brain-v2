Dear Sir/Madam,

RE: MEDICAL EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF PIP APPEAL

I am writing in my capacity as Ms Johnson's General Practitioner. I have been her GP for the past 8 years and have detailed knowledge of her medical conditions and their impact on her daily life.

DIAGNOSES:
1. Fibromyalgia (diagnosed 2019)
2. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/ME (diagnosed 2020)
3. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (ongoing since 2018)
4. Depression and Anxiety (diagnosed 2019)
5. Vitamin D deficiency
6. Chronic pain syndrome

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
- Pregabalin 150mg BD (for nerve pain)
- Duloxetine 60mg OD (for depression and pain)
- Tramadol 50mg PRN (for breakthrough pain)
- Omeprazole 20mg OD (for gastric protection)
- Vitamin D 4000iu daily
- Loperamide PRN (for IBS)
- Diazepam 2mg PRN (for anxiety - limited supply)

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:

Daily Living:
Ms Johnson experiences severe fatigue on approximately 5 out of 7 days. On these days, she struggles to get out of bed before midday and requires rest periods after minimal activity. She reports that tasks such as showering or preparing a simple meal leave her exhausted for hours.

She has significant difficulty with:
- Preparing meals: Cannot stand for more than 2-3 minutes without severe pain. Has burnt herself on several occasions due to cognitive fog affecting concentration.
- Personal care: Requires assistance getting in/out of bath. Takes 45-60 minutes to shower due to need for rest breaks.
- Managing medication: Partner organizes weekly pill box as she frequently forgets doses or becomes confused about what she has taken.
- Household tasks: Unable to perform cleaning, laundry, or shopping without significant help.

Mobility:
Ms Johnson reports she can walk approximately 20-50 meters before experiencing severe pain in her legs and lower back. She uses a walking stick on bad days (approximately 4 days per week). She experiences:
- Muscle weakness and poor balance
- Joint pain and stiffness, particularly in mornings
- Dizziness and fatigue after minimal exertion

Cognitive Function:
The "fibro fog" significantly impacts her ability to:
- Concentrate for more than 10-15 minutes
- Remember appointments or instructions
- Follow complex conversations
- Manage finances or correspondence

Mental Health:
Ms Johnson experiences moderate to severe depression related to her chronic conditions. She has:
- Low mood and tearfulness most days
- Social anxiety and avoidance of public places
- Panic attacks when attempting unfamiliar journeys
- Feelings of worthlessness and frustration at her limitations

VARIABILITY:
It is crucial to note that Ms Johnson's conditions are highly variable. She may have 1-2 "better" days per week where she can manage some basic activities, but these are followed by "crashes" lasting several days where she is essentially bedbound. Any assessment based on a single day would not accurately reflect her typical functioning.

PROGNOSIS:
These are chronic conditions with no cure. While we continue to try different treatment approaches, the prognosis is for long-term disability with possible slight improvements through careful pacing and symptom management.

PROFESSIONAL OPINION:
In my professional opinion, Ms Johnson requires substantial support with daily living activities and has severely restricted mobility. She meets the criteria for enhanced rate PIP for both components. The original assessment appears to have significantly underestimated the impact of her conditions.

I have reviewed the assessment report and note several inaccuracies:
- The assessor stated she appeared well-groomed - she had spent 3 hours preparing for the appointment with her partner's help
- Claims she mobilized normally - she used a walking stick which was noted at reception but not in the report
- States she drove to appointment - she was driven by her partner

I am happy to provide any further information required.

Yours faithfully,

Dr. Sarah Mitchell
