REASONS

INTRODUCTION
1. The Claimant was employed from 4 March 2019 until his dismissal on 15 November 2023. He claims unfair and wrongful dismissal arising from an email sent in error to a customer.

ISSUES
2. The Tribunal identified the following issues:
   a) What was the reason for dismissal?
   b) Was it a potentially fair reason under s.98(2) ERA 1996?
   c) Did the Respondent act reasonably in treating it as sufficient reason for dismissal?
   d) Was the dismissal procedurally fair?
   e) Should any award be reduced for contributory fault?
   f) Was the Claimant wrongfully dismissed?

FINDINGS OF FACT
3. The Claimant had 4 years and 8 months' continuous service with no disciplinary record.

4. On 23 October 2023, while processing multiple customer complaints, the Claimant drafted an internal email about Mrs Patricia Smith's complaint. He intended to forward it to his manager but accidentally clicked "Reply All".

5. The email stated: "Another moaning customer - this one's a right pain. Will sort it tomorrow."

6. Within 90 seconds, the Claimant sent a follow-up email to Mrs Smith:
   "I am mortified by my previous email sent in error. This was an internal comment never intended for you. I sincerely apologize for any offense caused. Your complaint is entirely valid and I will personally ensure it is resolved today. Again, my deepest apologies for this unprofessional error."

7. Mrs Smith replied the same day: "Thank you for your apology. We all make mistakes. I appreciate your honesty and quick response. Please just resolve my order issue."

8. The Claimant resolved Mrs Smith's complaint that afternoon. She did not pursue any complaint against him or the company.

9. On 1 November 2023, after investigation and disciplinary hearing, John Vale dismissed the Claimant for gross misconduct.

10. The appeal on 10 November 2023 was heard by Peter Vale, John Vale's brother.

11. We find:
    - Sarah Brown, a colleague, gave evidence that in September 2023, another employee sent internal comments to a supplier by mistake. They received a written warning.
    - The investigation was perfunctory, lasting 15 minutes
    - The disciplinary hearing lasted 20 minutes
    - No consideration was given to alternatives to dismissal
    - The Claimant's previous good record was dismissed as irrelevant

THE LAW
12. Section 98 ERA 1996 provides that misconduct is a potentially fair reason for dismissal.

13. The Tribunal must consider whether the employer acted reasonably in treating it as sufficient reason, considering:
    - Whether the employer believed the employee was guilty
    - Whether there were reasonable grounds for that belief
    - Whether there was reasonable investigation
    - Whether dismissal fell within the range of reasonable responses

14. This is the test in British Home Stores v Burchell [1980] ICR 303.

15. In Iceland Frozen Foods v Jones [1983] ICR 17, the EAT emphasized the "range of reasonable responses" test.

CONCLUSIONS - UNFAIR DISMISSAL

Reason for Dismissal
16. We accept the reason was conduct - the Claimant's email to the customer.

Reasonableness
17. Applying Burchell:
    a) The Respondent believed in the misconduct (admitted)
    b) There were reasonable grounds (the email existed)
    c) The investigation was inadequate but the facts were not disputed

18. However, we find dismissal was outside the range of reasonable responses because:

    a) Single incident: This was a one-off error in 4+ years of exemplary service
    
    b) Genuine mistake: The evidence overwhelmingly shows this was accidental:
       - Immediate recognition and apology
       - Clear intention to forward internally
       - Common "reply/forward" confusion
    
    c) Mitigation ignored: No reasonable employer would disregard:
       - Immediate apology
       - Customer acceptance
       - No actual damage
       - Previous good record
       - Recent "Employee of the Quarter" award
    
    d) Disproportionate sanction: Summary dismissal was excessive for:
       - An accident with no malicious intent
       - No financial loss
       - No lasting reputational damage
       - Customer relationship maintained
    
    e) Inconsistent treatment: Sarah Brown's evidence showed others who made similar errors received warnings, not dismissal

    f) Procedural flaws:
       - Cursory investigation
       - Predetermined outcome
       - Appeal heard by MD's brother (lack of independence)
       - No consideration of alternatives

19. While the email was regrettable, no reasonable employer would have dismissed in these circumstances. A warning would have been appropriate.

CONTRIBUTORY FAULT
20. The Claimant contributed to his dismissal through carelessness. We assess contribution at 25%.

WRONGFUL DISMISSAL
21. For wrongful dismissal, we must determine whether this was gross misconduct entitling summary dismissal.

22. Gross misconduct must be:
    - Deliberate wrongdoing, or
    - Gross negligence of such degree to amount to wrongdoing

23. This was neither. It was simple negligence - a momentary lapse. The Claimant was entitled to notice.

REMEDY
24. Basic Award:
    4 complete years x £532 (weekly pay) x 1 (age factor) = £2,128
    Rounded to £2,132

25. Compensatory Award:
    Loss of earnings (8 weeks to new job): £4,923
    Difference in salary (6 months): £1,000  
    Loss of benefits: £400
    Loss of statutory rights: £500
    Future loss (12 months differential): £2,000
    Total: £8,823
    Less 25% contributory fault: £6,617
    Plus ACAS uplift (10% - failure to consider alternatives): £662
    Total compensatory award: £7,760

26. Notice Pay: £2,667 (1 month gross)

27. Holiday Pay: 
    We find 5 days accrued but untaken = £736

28. Total Award: £13,295

OBSERVATIONS
29. This case demonstrates the importance of proportionate responses to employee misconduct. Employers must consider all relevant factors including previous record, mitigation, and actual harm caused. Zero-tolerance approaches to honest mistakes risk tribunals finding dismissals unfair.

30. We recommend the Respondent reviews its disciplinary procedures and ensures appeals are genuinely independent.
