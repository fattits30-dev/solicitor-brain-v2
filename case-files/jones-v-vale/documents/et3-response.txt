GROUNDS OF RESISTANCE

The Respondent denies that the dismissal was unfair and maintains it was a fair dismissal for gross misconduct.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The Claimant was employed as Sales Manager, a senior position with responsibility for customer relations and representing the company's reputation. His role explicitly required maintaining professional standards in all customer communications.

THE INCIDENT
On 23 October 2023, the Claimant sent an offensive email directly to a valued customer, Mrs Patricia Smith, describing her as "another moaning customer" and "a right pain". This was not a simple typing error but a fundamental breach of professional standards.

The impact was significant:
- Mrs Smith was deeply offended
- The company's reputation was damaged
- Other staff witnessed the unprofessionalism
- Trust in the Claimant's judgment was destroyed

INVESTIGATION AND DISCIPLINARY PROCESS
The Respondent followed a full and fair process:

1. Immediate suspension (25 October 2023) pending investigation
2. Investigation meeting (27 October 2023) where the Claimant admitted the facts
3. Consideration of all evidence including the Claimant's explanations
4. Disciplinary hearing (1 November 2023) conducted by John Vale
5. Full opportunity for the Claimant to present his case
6. Decision to dismiss for gross misconduct

The dismissal was within the band of reasonable responses. The Claimant:
- Sent offensive comments directly to a customer
- Breached the trust inherent in his senior position
- Violated clear policies on customer communication
- Damaged the company's reputation

GROSS MISCONDUCT
The Employee Handbook (page 23) specifically lists as gross misconduct:
"Offensive, abusive or aggressive behavior towards customers"
"Conduct bringing the company into disrepute"
"Serious breach of customer service standards"

The Claimant's actions fell squarely within these definitions.

APPEAL
The appeal was heard by Peter Vale, Operations Director, who has autonomous decision-making authority. The relationship to John Vale is irrelevant - the company has only 45 employees and limited senior management. The appeal was conducted fairly and the decision was reasonable.

PREVIOUS CONDUCT
While the Claimant had no formal warnings, this is irrelevant when gross misconduct occurs. A single act of gross misconduct justifies summary dismissal regardless of length of service.

CONSISTENCY
The Respondent denies inconsistent treatment. No other employee has sent offensive comments directly to customers. Minor internal errors are not comparable to customer-facing gross misconduct.

MITIGATION
The following were considered but did not alter the seriousness:
- The apology (damage was already done)
- Length of service (makes the breach worse, not better)
- Customer's response (irrelevant to the misconduct)

4.2 Was dismissal fair? Yes - for gross misconduct

5. WRONGFUL DISMISSAL

The Respondent resists this claim. The Claimant was guilty of gross misconduct entitling the Respondent to dismiss without notice under the contract clause 13.2.

6. WAGES OWED

6.1 Notice pay: Not owed - summary dismissal for gross misconduct
6.2 Holiday pay: The Claimant had taken 20 days holiday. With accrual of 23 days, only 3 days remained (£442), not 5 days as claimed

7. REMEDY

Should the Tribunal find unfair dismissal (which is denied):
- Any award should reflect 75% contributory fault
- A Polkey reduction of 100% should apply
- The Claimant failed to mitigate by taking 2 months to find work

8. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

The Respondent is a family-run SME employing 45 people. Customer reputation is vital to survival in a competitive market. The company cannot tolerate senior managers insulting customers.

The Claimant's "mistake" excuse is not credible:
- He typed a complete derogatory sentence
- He selected the customer's email address
- He clicked send without checking
- A Sales Manager should have better attention to detail

This was not a momentary lapse but a revelation of the Claimant's true attitude toward customers, incompatible with his role.
