4. UNFAIR DISMISSAL

4.1 I am making a claim of unfair dismissal

I was employed as Sales Manager from 4 March 2019 until my dismissal on 15 November 2023. I had over 4 years of continuous service with an unblemished disciplinary record.

INCIDENT
On 23 October 2023, I was dealing with a customer complaint via email. The customer, Mrs Patricia Smith, had complained about delayed delivery of custom blinds. I drafted an internal response for my manager but accidentally clicked "Reply All" instead of "Forward". The email contained the comment: "Another moaning customer - this one's a right pain. Will sort it tomorrow."

This was immediately followed by a second email apologizing profusely to Mrs Smith, explaining it was an internal comment sent in error, and that her complaint was valid and would be addressed immediately.

DISCIPLINARY PROCESS
On 25 October 2023, I was suspended pending investigation. The investigation meeting took place on 27 October 2023. I fully admitted the error, expressed genuine remorse, and explained the circumstances - I had been dealing with multiple complaints that day and was frustrated but this was never meant for the customer.

The disciplinary hearing on 1 November 2023 lasted only 20 minutes. John Vale, the Managing Director, stated that sending offensive comments to customers was gross misconduct. Despite my explanations that:
- It was a genuine mistake, not deliberate
- I had immediately apologized
- Mrs Smith had accepted my apology and not pursued the complaint
- I had 4 years' unblemished service
- I had recently won "Employee of the Quarter"

Mr Vale dismissed me with immediate effect for gross misconduct.

APPEAL
I appealed on 3 November 2023. The appeal on 10 November 2023 was heard by Peter Vale (MD's brother). He upheld the dismissal without properly considering my mitigation.

WHY THE DISMISSAL WAS UNFAIR
1. The sanction was too harsh - dismissal was not within the range of reasonable responses
2. No consideration of my long service and clean record
3. Other employees had made similar mistakes without dismissal
4. The appeal was not independent
5. The company failed to follow ACAS guidelines on disciplinary procedures

4.2 Do you have 2 years' continuous service? Yes
4.3 Were you dismissed? Yes
4.4 Date notice given: 01/11/2023
4.5 Date employment ended: 15/11/2023 (summary dismissal, notice not worked)

5. DISCRIMINATION

Not applicable

6. WAGES OWED

6.1 Notice pay: I was dismissed without notice. I am owed 1 month's notice pay (£2,667 gross)
6.2 Holiday pay: I had accrued 5 days' unused holiday (£736 gross)
6.3 Total owed: £3,403

7. WHAT DO YOU WANT?

I am seeking:

UNFAIR DISMISSAL
- A finding that I was unfairly dismissed
- Compensation for unfair dismissal including:
  * Basic award (4 complete years x 1 week x £532 cap) = £2,128
  * Compensatory award for loss of earnings
  * Loss of statutory rights
  * Loss of benefits

WRONGFUL DISMISSAL
- Notice pay of £2,667
- Holiday pay of £736

TOTAL ESTIMATED CLAIM: £15,000-20,000

I have mitigated my losses by immediately seeking alternative employment. I started a new role on 2 January 2024 at a lower salary (£28,000).

8. OTHER INFORMATION

ACAS Early Conciliation was attempted but unsuccessful. The respondent refused to engage meaningfully.

I have evidence including:
- The email chain showing the error and immediate apology
- Mrs Smith's email accepting the apology
- My employment contract and disciplinary policy
- Evidence of inconsistent treatment of other employees
- Character references from colleagues

9. DECLARATION

I confirm that the information given on this form is true and complete.
