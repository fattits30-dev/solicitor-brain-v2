Re: Mrs Margaret Smith (DOB: 03/11/1958)
NHS Number: 987 654 3210

Dear Sir/Madam,

RE: MEDICAL EVIDENCE FOR HOUSING BENEFIT APPEAL

I am writing as Mrs Smith's General Practitioner to provide medical evidence relevant to her Housing Benefit appeal. I have been her GP for the past 12 years and have detailed knowledge of her medical history and the impact of her husband's death on her mental and physical health.

MEDICAL HISTORY

Mrs Smith's relevant medical conditions include:
1. Type 2 Diabetes (diagnosed 2015)
2. Registered partially sighted (macular degeneration diagnosed 2018)
3. Osteoarthritis affecting mobility (ongoing)
4. Reactive depression following bereavement (December 2020)
5. Cognitive impairment secondary to depression (2021-2022)

IMPACT OF BEREAVEMENT

Mr Arthur Smith died suddenly on 15 December 2020 from a heart attack. They had been married for 42 years. The impact on Mrs Smith was devastating:

Immediate Period (December 2020 - March 2021):
- Severe shock and disbelief
- Unable to eat or sleep properly
- Lost 2 stone in weight
- Required sedation for panic attacks
- Daughter had to move in to provide 24-hour care

Acute Grief Phase (March 2021 - September 2021):
- Diagnosed with severe reactive depression
- Started on Sertraline 100mg daily
- Referred for urgent bereavement counselling
- Significant cognitive impairment noted:
  * Unable to concentrate for more than minutes
  * Forgot appointments repeatedly
  * Could not manage household bills
  * Confused about day/date
  * Made serious errors (left gas on, got lost locally)
- Required home visits as too distressed to attend surgery
- Daughter managing all practical affairs

Recovery Phase (September 2021 - June 2022):
- Gradual improvement with counselling
- Medication increased to Sertraline 150mg
- Still significantly impaired decision-making
- Continued memory problems
- Unable to process complex information

COGNITIVE ASSESSMENT

During the acute phase, I conducted basic cognitive assessments:
- Mini-Mental State Examination (March 2021): 19/30 (indicating moderate impairment)
- Repeat MMSE (September 2021): 23/30 (mild impairment)
- Clock drawing test: Significantly abnormal
- Unable to recall recent events
- Could not explain basic financial concepts

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT

During the period in question (February 2021 - March 2023), Mrs Smith was:
- Unable to manage financial affairs independently
- Could not understand or retain complex information
- Incapable of making informed decisions about benefits
- Reliant on daughter for all administrative tasks
- Frequently confused about her circumstances

SPECIFIC OBSERVATIONS

Regarding the life insurance payment (February 2021):
- Mrs Smith was in acute grief when payment received
- She had no understanding of benefit implications
- Believed the money was for funeral/debts only
- Cognitive impairment prevented rational decision-making
- Would not have understood disclosure requirements

I specifically recall a consultation on 3 March 2021 where Mrs Smith:
- Could not remember receiving any insurance money
- Thought her husband was still alive momentarily
- Was unable to explain what benefits she received
- Required daughter to answer all questions

VISUAL IMPAIRMENT

It's important to note Mrs Smith's partial sight registration:
- Cannot read standard print
- Requires large print (minimum 18 point)
- Cannot read lengthy documents
- Relies on others to read correspondence
- May not have been able to read benefit forms properly

CURRENT SITUATION

Mrs Smith has improved considerably but remains vulnerable:
- Still on antidepressants
- Requires ongoing support
- Diabetes poorly controlled due to stress
- Mobility deteriorating
- At risk of further decline if housing threatened

PROFESSIONAL OPINION

In my professional medical opinion:

1. Mrs Smith lacked mental capacity to understand benefit rules during the relevant period
2. Her cognitive impairment prevented informed decision-making
3. She could not reasonably be expected to comply with complex administrative requirements
4. The combination of bereavement, depression, cognitive impairment and visual problems created insurmountable barriers
5. Any suggestion of deliberate non-disclosure is medically implausible
6. Recovery action would likely cause significant deterioration in her mental and physical health

SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION

I attach:
- Consultation notes from December 2020 - December 2021
- Prescription history showing psychiatric medications
- Referral letters to mental health services
- Cognitive assessment results
- Ophthalmology reports confirming visual impairment

DECLARATION

I confirm this report is accurate and based on contemporaneous medical records. I am willing to provide further information if required.

Mrs Smith is a vulnerable elderly lady who was overwhelmed by grief when these events occurred. She was medically incapable of understanding or complying with benefit requirements. Any overpayment was entirely innocent and recovery would be unconscionable given her circumstances.

I trust this medical evidence will assist the Tribunal in reaching a just decision.

Yours faithfully,
