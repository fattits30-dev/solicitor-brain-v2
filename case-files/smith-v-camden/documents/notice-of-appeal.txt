SECTION 2: DECISION BEING APPEALED
Decision Maker: London Borough of Camden

Date of Decision: 15/05/2023
Date of Mandatory Reconsideration: 30/06/2023
Amount in Dispute: £8,426.50

SECTION 3: GROUNDS OF APPEAL

I am appealing the Council's decision to recover an alleged overpayment of Housing Benefit. The decision is wrong in fact and law for the following reasons:

1. DIMINISHED MENTAL CAPACITY
Following my husband's death on 15 December 2020, I suffered severe depression and cognitive impairment. My GP prescribed antidepressants and referred me for bereavement counselling. During this period, I was unable to properly manage my affairs or understand my benefit obligations.

2. NO DELIBERATE FAILURE TO DECLARE
I did not deliberately fail to declare the life insurance payment. I was overwhelmed with grief and genuinely did not understand that I needed to report it. The money was intended for funeral expenses and my husband's debts - I thought this was exempt from benefit calculations.

3. OFFICIAL ERROR
The Council's error contributed to the overpayment:
- Annual review forms did not specifically ask about capital or savings
- Despite knowing of my husband's death (I reported it immediately), no one advised me about declaring insurance payments
- The Council failed to make reasonable enquiries despite my vulnerability
- Previous review forms only asked about "changes in circumstances" which I didn't understand included insurance money

4. CAPITAL ALREADY SPENT
The insurance money was legitimately spent on:
- Funeral costs: £7,500
- Husband's credit card debts: £2,500
- House repairs (leak damage): £3,000
- Replacing essential items: £2,000
- Living expenses during benefit delays: £3,000

My current capital is below £6,000 and I am struggling financially.

5. EXCEPTIONAL HARDSHIP
Recovery would cause exceptional hardship because:
- I am 65 years old with health problems
- My only income is State Pension and Pension Credit
- I have no savings left
- I cannot afford basic necessities if my HB is reduced
- I am at risk of losing my home

6. REASONABLE EXCUSE
Even if there was a duty to declare, I had reasonable excuse:
- Severe bereavement reaction
- Cognitive impairment from depression
- No previous experience with insurance claims
- Reasonable belief funeral money was exempt
- Complex benefit rules not explained

SECTION 4: WHAT I WANT FROM THE TRIBUNAL

1. Find the overpayment decision is wrong
2. Alternatively, find the overpayment is not recoverable
3. Alternatively, write off the overpayment due to exceptional hardship
4. Reinstate my full Housing Benefit
5. Pay me the Housing Benefit withheld since April 2023

SECTION 5: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

- Ground floor hearing room (mobility problems)
- Large print documents (partially sighted)
- Morning hearing (diabetes medication routine)
- Daughter to attend as support person
